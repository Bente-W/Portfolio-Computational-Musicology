Although I am not a '70s kid, Queen is very nostalgic to me. I remember sitting in the backseat of the car, listening to my own CD with all the hits of the famous rock band. I could sing along to every song, even though I did not speak any English. The movie “Bohemian Rhapsody” portrayed (though not completely accurate) a small portion of the lives of the four band members. It reminded me of the solo careers three of the members had, only John Deacon never went solo. The drummer Roger Taylor was the first to release a solo album in 1981. After which Freddie Mercury and Brian May followed. When I heard “Time Waits For No One” for the first time not long ago, I thought it was just a Queen song I had not heard before. When I noticed that it was a song exclusively by Freddie Mercury, I wondered how it differed from songs produced by the band. Freddie Mercury has had less success as a solo artist than together with his three band members. 

Therefore, I will be comparing solo songs by Freddie Mercury with the songs from the band Queen. In addition to that, I am curious whether his solo career had any influence on the songs that were produced afterwards together with the band members. 

### Expectations
Freddie Mercury has released an album together with opera singer Montserrat Caballé, thus a few songs are collaborations of the two artists from which the song *Barcelona* is most famous. These partially operatic songs will differ from the Queen songs in genre and pitch. 
In addition, Freddie did seem to enjoy Disco music. Thus, on his album Mr. Bad Guy there are a few songs that resemble his love for Disco such as *I Was Born to Love You*. 

However, since Freddie Mercury was the chief songwriter of the band Queen, I expect lots of similarities in the songwriting.

### Representation
I have tried to make as complete a list as possible of the solo songs by Freddie Mercury. Nevertheless, there are a few non-original songs from the two albums he has released (*Mr. Bad Guy* and *Barcelona*) because those songs only are on Spotify as special editions (listed in *Song list 1.1*) or new orchestrated editions (listed in *Song list 1.2*).  I have decided to include the songs to have a bigger set of data since there already are much fewer solo songs by Freddie Mercury (N = 25) in comparison to songs by the band Queen (N = 159).
Regarding the band, I have made a playlist with all albums going from 1973 till 1995. Each Queen song is remastered in 2011, while Spotify only states that *In My Defence* by Freddie Mercury is remixed in 2000.
